      For last seven years, all I wanted to do is cook some good food. It has
      all started with Anthony Bourdain food-traveling books. I fell in love with
      the idea of cooking in different places around the world and absorbing all
      the different cultures that food represents. To do that, I needed to learn
      from the best. As soon as I graduated my University I went to France to join
      a culinary school in Bar-le-Duc. I've stayed in France for almost a year.
      Later on, I had a pleasure to work&learn from the best ones in Spain - The
      Basques. San Sebastian is a city which has the greatest amount of Michelin
      stars per capita. My personal life took me back to Poland, but even then
      I've tried to work along the best, and I had this privilege while working at
      Senses Restaurant (located in Warsaw), which was the best polish restaurant
      with 1* Michelin Star at the time. At the end of my journey I even became a
      Chef of co-opened restaurant. It was all tough. Time consuming.
      Exhausting. Heart-breaking. Beautiful. I have no regrets.
    </p>
    <p> Yet, the time has come for some
      changes. I would like to settle down a little bit, at least financially and professionally.
      Have some time for myself, my family, do some sports, read a book, learn something new.
      I need to find some work-life balance.

    <h2>Why IT sector?</h2>

    <p>
      Why IT? Why something so much different? When I realised that I need a change and my cooking career slowly comes
      to an end,
      I've started to wondering what I would like to do? What am I good at?
      I consider myself as a person who:
    <ul>
      <li>Is creative and good at maths</li>
      <li>Has out-of-the-box thinking</li>
      <li>Wants to learn something completely new</li>
      <li>Likes riddles and puzzles</li>
    </ul>
    Apart from that, I have a friends who work in IT sector and appreciate that a lot.
    So it was quite natural that IT sector came into my mind. My first thought was UX.
    I have graphic and composing background. I read a lot of UX books. I've started doing Google UX Certificate course.
    Yet, I realised that as a UX Designer I will lead a group of people who uses the technology that I have nothing in
    common, beside my Figma wireframes.
    That's why I decided to reach for the technology first, and then maybe move on to UX in a few years.

    <p>I'm hard-working and ambitious. I have good memory and learn new languages fast. I know, anyone can say that. But
      I've already proved that once - during my cooking career.
      Now, I'm ready to do it again. If You give me a chance. Your academy is a perfect place to start,
      and when I'll have someone to look up to and learn from, then I believe I will become a very valuable asset for
      the company.
